## SIR With Demographics

When new hosts being introduced into or removed from the population over time, we are not restricted to assuming that the pathogen eventually goes into extinction. If we want to explore dynamics of long-term persistence such as endemic or enzootic diseases, we must move past the assumption that the pathogen goes into extinction and account for demographic processes such as births (introduction of new susceptibles) and deaths (removal of hosts in all compartments).
